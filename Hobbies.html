    <h1> Fitness </h1> 

<p> Since the age of 16, I have actively been taking care of my health through consistent exercise and dieting. I closely track my calories depending on the time of year to achieve personal goals within the gym for a constant challenge against myself. I started off joining a boxing class at 16 and fell in love. After 3 years, I transitioned into weightlifting while still keeping my cardiovascular health in mind. I now work out 3-4 times a week and run twice a week, depending on my school workload. I am excited to graduate this semester so I can put more time into this hobby.  </p>


    <H1> Watches </H1> 

  <p> I have always loved watches, something about them fascinates me. It is more of a piece of art rather than a piece of jewelry. At the age of 12, I knew exactly which Rolex I was going to buy when I got older. After having bought and sold several watches since then, I learned how to make my own and customize them to my preference. Today, I have turned this hobby into a “side hustle” and sell bespoke watches all over the city. </p>  


    <h1> Cooking </h1>


<p>I began cooking around the age of 11 out of necessity due to no one being home when I finished school. I started off cooking simple meals like French toast and quesadillas for my little sister and I. From there, this hobby grew. By 16, I was cooking all 3 meals for my day by meal prepping earlier in the week. My first 3 jobs were cooking roles and I wanted to become a professional chef. After becoming a culinary lead at 19, I quickly realized this career was not one I would like to pursue professionally. My favourite cuisines to cook are Greek and Italian. Although this hobby has slowed down in recent years, I still like to put my apron on and cook for the family at least once a week.
