    <h4> I am currently a fourth-year student attending the Ted Rogers School of Management at Toronto Metropolitan University. </h4>
    

<h4> Throughout the program, I have delved into a diverse range of subjects encompassing both business management principles and cutting-edge technological concepts. I have studied core business disciplines such as accounting, finance, marketing, and management, while also gaining proficiency in areas such as information technology (IT), data analytics, cybersecurity, project management, and digital innovation. What sets the BTM program apart is its emphasis on practical, hands-on learning experiences. This program does a fantastic job of engaging in real-world projects, case studies, simulations, and collaborative group work, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge to solve complex business problems in a technological context. Additionally, the program offers opportunities for internships, co-op placements, and industry projects, enabling students to gain valuable work experience and build professional networks. </h4> 

<h4> I plan on graduating this April. After graduating, I intend to continue my education by taking courses, boot camps, and getting certificates to excel in my career in cybersecurity.
